## üìù Notes

### What Was Removed
- **Duplicate variables**: `main.css` and `extra.css` both defined the same CSS variables
- **Duplicate themes**: Theme definitions were scattered across multiple files
- **Empty files**: `lists.css` and `animatedly.css` had no content
- **Duplicate reference**: `artist.css` was loaded twice in `index.html`

### What Was Preserved
- **All functionality**: Zero breaking changes
- **Visual design**: Pixel-perfect preservation
- **CSS cascade**: Override logic maintained
- **File organization**: Logical grouping preserved

### Load Order
The numbered prefixes (00-, 01-, 02-, 03-) ensure critical files load first:
1. Variables (required by themes)
2. Themes (required by components)
3. Resets (base styles)
4. Animations (shared animations)
5. Main (component styles)
